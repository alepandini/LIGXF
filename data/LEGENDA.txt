Features are annotated according to reference cluster, e.g. c1_MC is the largest cluster where the M and C domain are used as reference. In addition:

score - docking score
rms   - RMS value for the docking score (10 poses of the same ligand)
rmsd  - RMSD value for the ligand coordinates (10 poses of the same ligand)
